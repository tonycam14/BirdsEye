# Objective
A personal project to create a device that can be instlled on a GA aircraft to detect specific anomalies via machine learning and AI such as stranded people in water, sharks in water, forest fires, car wrecks, pot farms and so on.


# Resources
- AWS Account
- Raspberry Pi
- Go Pro (we can change this out as it may not work)
- and a air plane :)

## Notes to self I feel like we will need sample images to perform the training so it knows what to look for. not sure how many we will need.


# Training A Model
1. Create a Sage Maker Instance
2. Do machine learning things with notebooks i think
3. Deploy model 


# Creating hardware for plane
1. Install greengrass on the Pi somehow
2. install Computer visiion
3. Install
